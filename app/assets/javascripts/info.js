At home, I prepared them by vigorous boil or the even lazier process of steeping in just-boiled water for 18 minutes.</p> <br> <p>Then, Alice Waters’s The Art of Simple Food showed me the light - that is, the deeply delicious sunshine that is a golden, just-set yolk at the center of a hard boiled egg. She calls them “hard cooked” because boiling has little place in her method.
